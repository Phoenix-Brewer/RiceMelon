pageDescription = Use this generator to create a Warrior Cat character, may it be for fanfictions, roleplays, or adopts! Bear in mind that some personallty traits and names may be contradicting; for example, you could get a trait pair like "cheerful yet pessimistic" or a name like "Firefire" or "fireflame". It is a random generator after all, so if this happens feel free to have a good laugh and reroll!
